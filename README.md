
# Event Manager 2.0

### Ideas to realize for V2

DevOps:
- [ ] NX monorepo
- [ ] CI for tests
- [ ] Deployment on Vercel (api, web, mobile)
- [ ] CD for deployment
- [ ] Deployment on AWS EC2
- [ ] CD for AWS deployment

Backend:
- [ ] Backend NestJS + TypeORM + GraphQL
- [ ] Backend Login + QR code
- [ ] Testing with SuperTests 100% coverage
- [ ] Testing in Postman
- [ ] Morpheus + Grafana monitoring on Docker container 

Frontend:
- [ ] MSW
- [ ] Cypress
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Storybook
- [ ] MaterialUI DataGrid
- [ ] Dark Mode MUI
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Toasts
- [ ] Map Location

Mobile:

# Events Manager - backend v1

### The project has been prepared in TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology. 

### This was my first project in which I used this methodology, so I had to learn a lot of new things.

### Challanges

- I had to learn how to configure JEST with TypeScript.
- I had to learn how to use the TDD methodology and get used to writing small chunks.
- I had to learn how to use Sequelize library - previously been using TypeORM.
- I had to check TypeScript details in a lot of cases, typescript is a very powerful tool, but it is also very easy to make a mistake.

---
### Main project goal was to save the event with following fields: 
- first name 
- second name 
- email 
- date 

### Finally it was too little and, there is CRUD functionality for all events.

---
### Installation:
- clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:Fremen1990/events_manager.git` (if you have not done it yet for Front-end)
- go to the server folder `cd server`
- run `yarn` in the root directory

### Run the project:
- run `yarn dev` to start the server
- run `yarn test` to run tests
- run `yarn test:coverage` to run tests with coverage

### Avaialabel endpoints:

- GET /api - Hi message

- GET /api/events/all - get all events

- GET /api/events/:id - get event by id
- POST /api/events - create new event
- PUT /events/:id - update event by id
- DELETE /events/:id - delete event by id

### Challanges:

- I had to learn how to use the TDD methodology and get used to writing small chunks without seeing it.
- I had to learn how to use React Testing Library with TypeScript.
- I had to find a way to test the components that use the Context API.
